    it is a SuperSU backup
  * installer: let the user choose whether to
    install microG with official PlayStore or
    with unofficial YalpStore
  * When YalpStore is installed, also install
    FakeStore, so that apps that expect PlayStore
    still work. This also ensures SafetyNet
    responses work as they should.
