## Details

### NanoMod

This lists features unique to NanoMod.

#### nanomod-overlay

The `nanomod-overlay` script handles the following features

* pseudo-debloat (Magisk-only)
  * show the list of pseudo-debloated apps
  * add or remove apps from the list of pseudo-debloated apps
* grant signature spoofing permission to microG and Play Store if required
  * both in Magisk and System Mode
* issue `nanomod-overlay --help` for the full list of options

Full details on the pseudo-debloat feature [![GitHub Link](images/github.png)](doc/PseudoDebloat.md)

#### init scripts

The following init scripts are bundled with NanoMod

* external_sd
  * symlink SD Card mount point to `/external_sd`
* fstrim
 * trim file systems (may increase speed)
* logscleaner
  * clean up log files
* sqlite
  * clean up sqlite databases

When in Magisk Mode the init scripts create their log files in

  `/magisk/NanoMod/.logs/${script}.log.${date}`

When installed to /system your ROM needs to support running scripts in

  `/system/etc/init.d`

or you can use **Kernel Adiutor's** init.d emulation.

### microG

microG is an Open Source replacement for Google Services, full details can be found at the microG homepage [![Web Link](images/microg.png)](http://microg.org/)

NanoMod includes microG as follows

* microG GmsCore [![GitHub Link](images/github.png)](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore) and Play Store [![APK Mirror Link](images/apkmirror.png)](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/google-inc/google-play-store/)  modified to allow (in-)app purchases
* with **Mozilla** location provider backend [![F-Droid Link](images/fdroid.png)](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=mozilla&fdid=org.microg.nlp.backend.ichnaea)
* with **Nominatim** adress provider backend [![F-Droid Link](images/fdroid.png)](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=nominatim&fdid=org.microg.nlp.backend.nominatim)
* with **microG** GsfProxy [![GitHub Link](images/github.png)](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GsfProxy)
* with **microG** DroidGuard Helper [![GitHub Link](images/github.png)](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_RemoteDroidGuard)
* choose between official **Play Store** or unofficial **Yalp Store** [![F-Droid Link](images/fdroid.png)](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=yalp&fdid=com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore)
  * **Yalp Store** can use system permissions to install packages, so you don't need to enable `Unknown Sources`
    * got to **Yalp Store** > Settings > Installation Method > `Using system permissions`
* support for Maps API version 1

### F-Droid and Applications

F-Droid [![F-Droid Link](images/fdroid.png)](http://www.fdroid.org) is an app store for Open Source applications.

NanoMod includes both F-Droid and it's Privileged Extension, so you don't need to enable `Unknown Sources`.

Additionally NanoMod includes a variety of applications, check full details [![GitHub Link](images/github.png)](doc/Applications.md)

### The Legend of Zelda ringtones and sounds

NanoMod includes **The Legend of Zelda** rintones and sounds [![Nintendo Link](images/zelda.png)](http://www.zelda.com/), because it's dangerous to root alone

## Installation

### Alter Installation

NanoMod supports configuration files to alter the installation settings.

Full details on altering installation [![GitHub Link](images/github.png)](doc/AlterInstallation.md)

### Installation Process

#### NanoMod

* Download release build or create zip file from the github repository
* perform full wipe (/system, /data, /cache, Dalvik/ART cache)
  * recommended, but not required
* install desired ROM
  * make sure it does **not** include GApps if you want to use microG
  * either pre-patched with signature spoofing support or **deoxeded** so you can patch yourself (instructions follow)
* install desired Kernel (if any)
* install **Magisk**
  * recommended, but not required
  * if **Magisk** is installed, NanoMod will be installed as Magisk-Module, else it will install into `/system` directly
* install **NanoMod**
* reboot into ROM

#### microG

For **microG** to work, your ROM needs to have signature spoofing enabled (or a **deodexed** ROM to patch yourself).

If your ROM does not have signature spoofing support, you can manually patch it using either
  * the on-device framework-patcher zip
    * flash after booting into the ROM once
  * the `framework-patcher.sh` script (found in the github repository)
    * usefrom your PC / laptop. This shell script for GNU Bash (and compatible shells) works on Unixoid operating systems like GNU/Linux, BSD or Mac OSX. It automizes the process of downloading Haystack [![GitHub Link](images/github.png)](https://github.com/Lanchon/haystack), pulling files from phone, patching and installing the patched **services.jar**

Once your ROM supports signature spoofing, you need to setup microG like this
  * go into **microG settings** and set up everything like:
    * check results in **Self-Check**, grant missing permissions (by tapping on them)
      * especially the 'Battery Optimization' item
    * enable **Google device registration**
    * enable **Google Cloud Messaging** (only if you want to receive push messages from your applications)
    * enable **Google SafetyNet** (only if you you want to be able to use applications that require SafetyNet, for example AndroidPay, Pok√©mon GO, ...)
      * set to use the official servers
    * in **UnifiedNlp Settings** choose
      * **Mozilla Location Backend** as Geolocation backend
      * **Nominatim** as Address lockup backend
    * after everything is done, reboot
    * go to **Play Store**, setup account and install your apps

### Issues

List of known issues

* microG DroidGuard Helper or Play Store crashing
  * there's currently an issue with **Magisk** that prevents microG DroidGuard Helper or Play Store from properly working when magic-mounted as `/system` application, see Magisk Issue 155 [![GitHub Link](images/github.png)](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/issues/155)
  * this does not happen on all devices
  * if you are affected of this issue, instead install them as an user app, by installing the apk from
    * `/system/priv-app/DroidGuard/DroidGuard.apk` for microG DroidGuard Helper
    * `/system/priv-app/Phonesky/Phonesky.apk` for Play Store
* SafetyNet check fails with `can't connect to Google API`
  * see `microG DroidGuard Helper or Play Store crashing` above and install microG DroidGuard Helper as user application
* Play Store lacks fake sign permission
  * on ROMs like **crDroid** or **OmniROM**, that have built-in fake signing and don't require running `framework-patcher.sh`, in some cases the Play Store is not granted fake sign permission, to fix this issue one of the following commands as root on your phone
    * `nanomod-overlay --permission`
    * `pm grant com.android.vending android.permission.FAKE_PACKAGE_SIGNATURE`
* Battery Drain
  * microG fails to register applications  to GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) if they were installed **before** microG, but the apps keep trying to register and that causes the battery drain, all apps installed **after** microG are properly registered, to fix the battery drain either
    * do a clean flash of your ROM (,Magisk) and NanoMod and install your apps after microG setup
    * uninstall and re-install all your applications (backup application data if required)
