Installation
============

* Download stable release from [Androidfilehost](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?a=show&w=files&flid=150729)
* or create zip file from this repository
  - on Linux you can use the provided mod.sh script: `mod.sh zip`
* perform full wipe
* install desired ROM
  - make sure it does NOT include GApps, if you choose microG!)
* install desired Kernel (if any)
* install NanoMod
  * if you have choosen microG you need to patch the framework for signature
    spoofing. Some ROMs already include support for that, for example crDroid.
    If your ROM does not have signature spoofing included (very likely), patch
    the framework manually like:
    - in TWRP mount system partition
    - get [Tingle](https://github.com/ale5000-git/tingle) framework patcher
    - execute Tingle and choose ADB as source for framework
    - your framework.jar will now be patched for microG to work
* reboot into system
  * if you have choosen microG
    - go into 'microG settings' and set up everything like:
      + check results in 'Self-Check', grant missing
        permissions (by tapping on them)
      + enable 'Google device registration'
      + enable 'Google Cloud Messaging' (only if you want to
        receive push messages from your applications)
      + enable 'Google SafetyNet' (only if you you want to
        be able to use applications that require SafetyNet,
        for example AndroidPay, Pokemon GO, ...), set to
        use the official servers
      + under 'UnifiedNlp Settings' choose
        + 'Mozilla Location Backend' as Geolocation backend
        + 'Nominatim' as Address lockup backend
    - after everything is done, reboot
    - go to playstore, setup account and install your apps

SafetyNet
=========

To pass SafetyNet enable MagiskHide in MagiskManager. Make sure
your ROM/Kernel sets Selinux to permissive, as Magisk v11 does
have it's own pseudo-enforcing Selinux mode.

After enabling MagiskHide reboot.

Hiding Root from Apps
=====================

After enabling MagiskHide and reboot go to MagiskManager again,
you'll now notice a new 'MagiskHide' settings tab. In this tab
you can select any application root should be hidden for. No reboot
is required for this to take effect.

Note: don't select too many apps (10+), else MagiskHide may be too
slow to actually hide root before the application checks for it.
