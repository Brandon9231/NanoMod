    - execute Tingle and choose ADB as source for framework
    - Tingle will now patch your framework.jar in order for
    microG to work

SafetyNet
=========

To pass SafetyNet enable MagiskHide in MagiskManager. Make sure
your ROM/Kernel sets Selinux to permissive, as Magisk v11 does
have it's own pseudo-enforcing Selinux mode.

After enabling Magisk Hidereboot.

Hiding Root from Apps
=====================

After enabling Magisk Hide and reboot go to MagiskManager again,
you'll now notice a new 'MagiskHide' settings tab. In this tab
you can select any application root should be hidden for. No reboot
is required for this to take effect.

Note: don't select too many apps (10+), else MagiskHide may be too
slow to actually hide root before the application checks for it.
