NanoMod
=======

NanoMod makes several modifications to your ROM:

* user-friendly AROMA installer
* debloat ROM and remove stock CM su binary
* install microG with either unofficial YalpStore or official PlayStore
  - for more information on microG visit [microG Homepage](http://www.microg.org)
  - with Mozilla location provider backend
  - with Nominatim adress provider backend
* install F-Droid and many OpenSource applications
  - for more information on F-Droid visit [F-Droid Homepage](http://www.fdroid.org)
* install The Legend of Zelda tunes
* install Magisk and companion modules
  - for more information on Magisk visit [XDA Magisk Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk)
* install GNU Bash Shell
* install GNU Nano Shell Editor

Why was this created?
=====================

Because I wanted to have a simple way to achieve my desired setup on any device
or any ROM. That's it, basically. And since it already exists, I thought I'd push
it to XDA aswell. Actually this is the generic version of my NanoROM for Galaxy S6,
where I basically made the same changes to the ROM (except NanoMod is for LOS/AOSP
based ROMs, not TouchWiz).

Magisk & root
=============

Magisk allows modifying the ROM in system less fashion, it also
brings it's own root solution (MagiskSU, which apparently is a
fork of PHH SuperUser) and an companion application.

If Magisk is choosen to be installed, any previously installed
root solution will be removed. NanoMod will also re-flash the
boot image backup if you had system less SuperUser installed,
that is to ensure MagiskSU is properly installed and working.

The following Magisk/Modules can be choosen to be installed:

* Magisk
  - with builtin SuperUser
  - with Magisk Manager companion application
* Nano-Init (init scripts)
  - fstrim (optimize filesystems)
  - logscleaner (clean old logfiles)
  - sqlite (optimize sqlite databases)
  - selinux (apply changes to selinux files for Samsung devices)
* Nano-Miitomo (prevents Miitomo crashes on Custom ROMs)
  - Miitomo does not crash because of rooted devices,
    but it does crash if 'ro.debuggable' is '1'. This
    Magisk module uses `resetprop` to set it to '0'.

SafetyNet
=========

To pass SafetyNet enable MagiskHide in MagiskManager. Make sure
your ROM/Kernel sets Selinux to permissive, as Magisk v11+ does
have it's own pseudo-enforcing Selinux mode.

After enabling MagiskHide reboot.

Hiding Root from Apps
=====================

After enabling MagiskHide and reboot go to MagiskManager again,
you'll now notice a new 'MagiskHide' settings tab. In this tab
you can select any application root should be hidden for. No reboot
is required for this to take effect.

Note: don't select too many apps (10+), else MagiskHide may be too
slow to actually hide root before the application checks for it.

Zelda Ringtones

The following The Legend of Zelda can be choosen to be installed (all or none):

::Notification sounds

* Flute
* Gold Bug Catch
* Hey Listen
* Intro

Installation
============

* Download stable release from [Androidfilehost](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?a=show&w=files&flid=150729)
* or create zip file from this repository
  - on Linux you can use the provided mod.sh script: `mod.sh zip`
* perform full wipe
* install desired ROM
  - make sure it does NOT include GApps, if you choose microG!)
* install desired Kernel (if any)
* install NanoMod
  * if you have choosen microG you need to patch the framework for signature
    spoofing. Some ROMs already include support for that, for example crDroid.
    If your ROM does not have signature spoofing included (very likely), use
    the supplied framework-patcher.sh. This shell script for GNU Bash (and
    compatible shells) works on GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris and the-like. It
    automizes the process of downloading [Haystack](https://github.com/Lanchon/haystack),
    pulling files from phone, mounting /system read-write in TWRP, patching files
    and pushing modified files to the device. See `framework-patcher.sh --help`
    for more information.
* reboot into system
  * if you have choosen microG
    - go into 'microG settings' and set up everything like:
      + check results in 'Self-Check', grant missing
        permissions (by tapping on them)
      + enable 'Google device registration'
      + enable 'Google Cloud Messaging' (only if you want to
        receive push messages from your applications)
      + enable 'Google SafetyNet' (only if you you want to
        be able to use applications that require SafetyNet,
        for example AndroidPay, Pokemon GO, ...), set to
        use the official servers
      + under 'UnifiedNlp Settings' choose
        + 'Mozilla Location Backend' as Geolocation backend
        + 'Nominatim' as Address lockup backend
    - after everything is done, reboot
    - go to playstore, setup account and install your apps
