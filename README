Installation
============

* create zip file from this repository and copy on your device
  * on GNU/Linux or BSD (or compatible) you can use the provided
    makezip.sh script
* perform full wipe
* install desired ROM (make sure it does NOT include GApps!)
* install desired Kernel (if any)
* install NanoMod
* in TWRP mount system partition
  - get Tingle from https://github.com/ale5000-git/tingle
  - execute Tingle and choose ADB as source for framework
  - Tingle will now patch your framework.jar in order for
    microG to work
* reboot into system
* go into 'microG settings' and set up everything, check results
  in 'self check' lists, once done, reboot
* go to playstore, setup account as usual and install yer apps

Root not working
================

Open the Super User app once and take the quick guide. It may
*sometimes* happen, that the root prompt won't show up otherwise.

SafetyNet
=========

To pass SafetyNet enable Magisk Hide in Magisk Settings. The
Nano-Selinux-Enforce module ensures selinux is enforcing, else
your device will not pass SafetyNet regardless of Magisk Hide.

After enabling Magisk Hide reboot.

Hiding Root from Apps
=====================

After enabling Magisk Hide and reboot go to Magisk Manager again,
you'll now notice a new 'Magisk Hide' settings tab. In this tab
you can select any application root should be hidden for. No reboot
is required for this to take effect.

Note: don't select too many apps (10+), else Magisk Hide may be too
slow to actually hide root before the application checks for it.
